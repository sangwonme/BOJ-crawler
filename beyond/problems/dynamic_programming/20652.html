            <h1>20652. Stuck in a Rut</h1>
<p>Farmer John has recently expanded the size of his farm, so from the
perspective of his cows it is effectively now infinite in size! The cows think
of the grazing area of the farm as an infinite 2D grid of square "cells", each
filled with delicious grass (think of each cell as a square in an infinite
chessboard). Each of Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1\le N\le 50$) starts out in a
different cell; some start facing north, and some start facing east.</p>
<p>Every hour, every cow either</p>
<ul>
<li>Stops if the grass in her current cell was already eaten by another cow.</li>
<li>Eats all the grass in her current cell and moves one cell forward according to the direction she faces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, each cow therefore leaves a barren "rut" of empty cells behind her.</p>
<p>If two cows move onto the same grassy cell in the same move, they share the
cell and continue moving in their respective directions in the next hour.</p>
<p>Please determine the amount of grass eaten by each cow. Some cows never stop,
and therefore eat an infinite amount of grass.</p>
<h2>입력</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains $N$. Each of the next $N$ lines describes the
starting location of a cow, in terms of a character that is either N (for
north-facing) or E (for east-facing) and two nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$
($0\le x\le 10^9$, $0\le y\le 10^9$) giving the coordinates of a cell. All
$x$-coordinates are distinct from each-other, and similarly for the
$y$-coordinates.</p>
<p>To be as clear as possible regarding directions and coordinates, if a cow is
in cell $(x,y)$ and moves north, she ends up in cell $(x,y+1)$. If she instead
had moved east, she would end up in cell $(x+1, y)$.</p>
<h2>출력</h2>
<p>Print $N$ lines of output. Line $i$ in the output should describe the number
of cells worth of grass that the $i$th cow in the input eats. If a cow eats an
infinite amount of grass, output "Infinity" for that cow.</p>
